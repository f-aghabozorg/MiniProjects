//Command

/*
 *  Intent:
    Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
    This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
  
 *  A command is nothing more than a data class with its members describing what to do and how to do it
