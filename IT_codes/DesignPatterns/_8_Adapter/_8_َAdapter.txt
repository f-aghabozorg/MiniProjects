// Adapter

/*
 *  Intent:
   The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects.
   It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.
  
 *  Identification: 
    Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of a different abstract/interface type.
    When the adapter receives a call to any of its methods, 
    it translates parameters to the appropriate format and then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.
