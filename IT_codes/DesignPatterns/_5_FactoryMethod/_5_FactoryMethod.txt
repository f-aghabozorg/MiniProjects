// FactoryMethod

/*
 * Factory method is a creational design pattern 
 * which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 * >>> The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). 
 * Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
 * 
 * 
 *  Intent:
 *  Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
 *  but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 * 
 *  Identification:
 *  Factory methods can be recognized by creation methods that construct objects from concrete classes. 
 *  While concrete classes are used during the object creation, 
 *  the return type of the factory methods is usually declared as either an abstract class or an interface.
