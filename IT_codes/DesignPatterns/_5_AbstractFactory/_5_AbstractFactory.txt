//abstract Factory

/*
 *  Intent:
    Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related (or dependant) objects 
    without specifying their concrete classes.    
   
 *  Identification: 
   The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object.
   Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

   to have a flexible system
   Example:
   some pair of (x,y)s : UI Controls that need to be platform independant (windows - macOs - linux)
   a factory (like an interface) with multiple concrete factories and also for product and concrete product
