//abstract Factory

/*
 *  Intent:
    Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects 
    without specifying their concrete classes.    
   
 *  Identification: 
   The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object.
   Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

 * Let's encapsulate the instatiation 
   Why FactoryMehod?
   1- Because of Business Logic of Parameters you want to pass to a Particular class and work with which class
   2- Polymorphism: wrap the construction with an instance (factory), so you can swap the instances of Factories
